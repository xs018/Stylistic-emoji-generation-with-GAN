# Employing Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) for the Creation of Stylistic Emojis
EmotiGAN addresses this challenge by integrating methodologies from two distinct fields. Initially, the architecture primarily leverages the framework of Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGAN), which has demonstrated significant efficacy across various domains concerning image generation. Subsequently, the approach incorporates a pre-trained word2vec model to transform textual data into embeddings, facilitating their use as input for our GAN. Section 3 in the report provides a comprehensive exploration of the design and implementation of these critical components.
